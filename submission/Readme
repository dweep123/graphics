In this assignment we have tried to capture motion of an android using the the four arrow keys
->  =>   	turns robot to its left
<-  =>		turns it to right
up  =>  	increases the speed
j   =>          jumps the robot in parabolic motion if their is some horizontal speed given to the robot
t   => 		toggles the view between tower and first person view(person person being the default view)
Also there are two texture files which puts the texture on tile and the water
Check function in the code currently checks if the current position of robot is safe or not 
Missing_tiles enables random tiles to be invisible
